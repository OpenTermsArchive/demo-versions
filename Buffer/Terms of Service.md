| **10.4** **Repeat Infringers**<br><br>Buffer’s policy is to: (a) remove or disable access to material that Buffer believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property rights owner or authorized agent, is infringing the intellectual property rights of a third party by being made available through the Service; and (b) in appropriate circumstances, to terminate the accounts of and block access to the Service by any user who repeatedly or egregiously infringes other people’s copyright or other intellectual property rights. Buffer will terminate the accounts of users that are determined by Buffer to be repeat infringers. Buffer reserves the right, however, to suspend or terminate accounts of users in our sole discretion.<br><br>**10.5 Counter Notification**<br><br>If you receive a notification from Buffer that material made available by you on or through the Service has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then you will have the right to provide Buffer with what is called a “**Counter Notification**.” To be effective, a Counter Notification must be in writing, provided to the Designated Agent through one of the methods identified in Section 10.2 (DMCA Notification), and include substantially the following information:<br><br>* **your physical or electronic signature;**<br>* **identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;**<br>* **a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and**<br>* **your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if you are residing outside of the United States, then for any judicial district in which may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under the Section 10.2 (DMCA Notification)above or an agent of that person.**<br><br>A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm the party’s obligations to provide a valid counter notification under the Copyright Act.<br><br>**10.6 Reposting of Content Subject to a Counter Notification.**<br><br>If you submit a Counter Notification in response to a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then Buffer will promptly provide the person who provided the Notification of Claimed Infringement with a copy of your Counter Notification and inform that person that Buffer will replace the removed User Content or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days, and Buffer will replace the removed User Content and cease disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the Counter Notification, unless Buffer’s Designated Agent receives notice from the party that submitted the Notification of Claimed Infringement that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on Buffer’s system or network.<br><br>**10.7 False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications.**<br><br>The Copyright Act provides at 17 U.S.C. § 512(f) that: “\[a\]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under \[Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)\] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of Buffer relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.” Buffer reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a Notification of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notification in violation of the law. | If you repeatedly violate others’ copyrights, we may close your account. |

| **14\. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration**<br><br>**14.1 Generally**<br><br>In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Buffer in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in the Arbitration provisions, you and Buffer agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms, the Service, and communications from us will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, the Service, or any communications to or from us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND BUFFER ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.<br><br>**14.2 Exceptions**<br><br>Despite the provisions of 14.1 (Generally) [above](#14.1), nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.<br><br>**14.3 Opt-Out**<br><br>If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by emailing us at legal@buffer.com or sending a letter to Buffer, Inc, Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 2443 Fillmore Street [#380-7163](https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23380-7163), San Francisco, CA 94115, that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“**Opt-Out Notice**”). Once Buffer receives your Opt-Out Notice, Section 14.1 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 15 [(Governing Law)](#15.2). The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.<br><br>**14.4 Arbitrator**<br><br>Any arbitration between you and Buffer will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “**AAA Rules**”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/), by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Buffer. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.<br><br>**14.5 Notice of Arbitration; Process.**<br><br>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“**Notice of Arbitration**”). Buffer’s address for Notice is: Buffer, Inc., 2443 Fillmore Street [#380-7163](https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23380-7163), San Francisco, CA 94115.The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“**Demand**”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Buffer may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Buffer must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Buffer in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Buffer will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000.<br><br>**14.6 Fees**<br><br>If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Buffer will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee in accordance with AAA rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in the county and state of your billing address or another mutually agreed location, but if the claim is for US$10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Buffer for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<br><br>**14.7 No Class Actions**<br><br>YOU AND BUFFER AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Buffer agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.<br><br>**14.8 Modifications to this Arbitration Provision**<br><br>If Buffer makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Buffer’s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Buffer’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Buffer will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.<br><br>**14.9 Enforceability**<br><br>If Section 14.7 (No Class Actions) above or the entirety of this Section 14 is found to be unenforceable, or if Buffer receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 14 will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 15 ([Governing Law](#15.2)) will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms. | You agree that disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. You and Buffer are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in any class action or representative proceeding. You can opt out of the binding arbitration within 30 days of agreeing to these Terms by sending a letter to us or by emailing us at legal@buffer.com. |

Use of Section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to.” If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.<br><br>**15.2** **Governing Law**<br><br>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles.
