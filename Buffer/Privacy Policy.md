GDPR compliance
---------------

The EU’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) took effect May 25, 2018 and we are fully behind the spirit of these regulations for a safe and secure Internet. We aspire to embrace privacy by design and, whenever possible, to not collect and store personally-identifiable information.

Our [Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy) contains mentions of the few instances where personally-identifiable information is required. Typically this will include an email address in order to log in to Buffer or a social network username in order to manage your account.

Overall, we aim for privacy by default: if data collection is not integral to the way our product works, then we won’t collect it. This approach has felt very much in line with the spirit of GDPR, and we’re fortunate that a lot of these data collection practices have been in place at Buffer for some time. As such, you may see few banners or forms requesting consent for us to collect personally-identifiable information for tracking or other purposes. We don’t deem this information necessary to provide Buffer’s service to you, and we choose not to engage in activities and strategies that make this data relevant.

At any time, you may request your information to be exported and sent to you for review, and we promptly honor any requests by you to have your information deleted and forgotten.

### Deletion

A user has the right to request that we delete all of their personal data by deleting their Buffer account. [Delete my data](https://account.buffer.com/).

### Access / Portability

A user can request access to a copy of the personal data that we have collected. Users who wish to request portability can reach out to us at any time. [Get in touch](mailto:privacy@buffer.com?subject=Please%20send%20me%20my%20data%20[Portability%20request]).

### Modification

If a user asks to change their information, we can do so within our admin portal. If a user has a modification to make, they can reach out to us at [privacy@buffer.com](mailto:privacy@buffer.com).

### Data Protection Agreement

We have created a legal agreement that users and external parties can receive from us, promising the protection all personally identifiable information that we collect and store. [See the full agreement](https://dochub.com/buffer/Xv7zYW5RnzkbEZR2A9egxG/buffer-data-processing-addendum).

Data Privacy Frameworks Policy (DPFs Policy)
--------------------------------------------

Buffer Inc. (“Buffer”) complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the UK Extension to the Data Privacy Framework (the “DPFs”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information (as defined below) that is transferred from the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom (“UK”) and/or Switzerland, to the United States. Buffer has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the DPFs Principles (the “Principles”) with respect to such information.

Buffer will not rely on the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework or the UK Extension to the Data Privacy Framework until each enters into force, but Buffer adheres to their required commitments in anticipation of their doing so.

If there is any conflict between the terms in this DPFs Policy and the Principles, the Principles will govern. To learn more about the DPFs, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/)

This DPFs Policy supplements our [Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy). Capitalized terms used in this DPFs Policy have the meaning given to them by our [Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy), unless specifically defined in this DPFs Policy. In case of conflict between our [Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy)and this DPFs Policy with regard to our privacy practices under the DPFs, this DPFs Policy prevails. This Policy applies to Buffer, which is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.

### Personal Information Received from the EEA, UK & Switzerland

Buffer may receive from the EEA, UK and Switzerland some or all of the information listed in our [Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy). Some of that information may qualify as “personal information” or “personal data” (collectively, “PersonalInformation”) as defined in the Principles. To the extent that Buffer receives Personal Information from the EEA, UK or Switzerland, Buffer will handle such Personal Information in accordance with the Principles.

### How We Obtain Personal Information

We obtain and process Personal Information in different capacities.

As a data controller, we collect and process Personal Information from the EEA, UK and Switzerland when offering our products and services to individuals as set forth in our [Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy).

As a data processor, we process Personal Information from the EEA, UK and Switzerland on behalf of our commercial customers when providing our B2B products and services. In that context, we only process Personal Information on behalf of and at the direction of our commercial customers (which are data controllers), as explained in the [Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy).

For all types of processing, Buffer commits to the Principles of the DPFs with respect to all Personal Information received from the EEA, UK and Switzerland.

### Notice

We provide information regarding our privacy practices in our [Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy).

When we process Personal Information on behalf of our commercial customers, our commercial customers determine the categories of data they provide to our Service and the purposes of the processing. Accordingly, our commercial customers are responsible for providing notice to individuals and you should review their privacy policies for more information regarding their data processing practices.

### Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation

Buffer may use the Personal Information it receives from the EEA, UK and Switzerland for the purposes set forth in our [Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy) or as you may otherwise be notified. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Information we process is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current to the extent necessary for the purposes for which we use the Personal Information. We will not process Personal Information in a way that is incompatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by you. We will adhere to the Principles for as long as we retain the Personal Information.

### Onward Transfers

Our [Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy) describes the circumstances in which we may disclose your information to third parties. We remain responsible for the processing of Personal Information received under the DPFs and subsequently transferred to a third party acting as an agent if the agent processes such Personal Information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. We may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

### Data Security

We use reasonable and appropriate measures to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Information.

### Choice

We will give you an opportunity to choose whether your Personal Information may be used for a purpose that is materially different from the purposes for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you, or if we intend to disclose it to a third party acting as a data controller that we have not previously disclosed to you. In such circumstances, we will notify you and offer you the opportunity to opt-out of such uses and/or disclosures where non-sensitive Personal Information is involved, and to opt-in where sensitive Personal Information is involved.

### Access to Personal Information

Where appropriate, Buffer will provide you with access to the Personal Information that we maintain about you. Buffer will also correct, amend or delete Personal Information that we maintain about you when it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of the Principles and you send a written request to us using the information provided in the“Contact Information” section below. We will review your request in accordance with the Principles, and may limit or deny access to Personal Information where providing such access is unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by the Principles.

When we process Personal Information on behalf of our commercial customers, our commercial customers control the type of information we obtain, how that information is used and disclosed, and how it can be modified. Accordingly, if you wish to request access, limit use or disclosure of your Personal Information, please contact us using the information provided in the “Contact Information” section below.

### Recourse and Enforcement

We conduct an annual self-assessment of our Personal Information practices to verify that the attestations and assertions made in this Policy are true and have been implemented as represented.

If you have any questions or concerns, we encourage you to write to us at the address listed below. We will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints or disputes regarding our use and disclosure of Personal Information in accordance with the Principles. Within the scope of this privacy notice, if a privacy complaint or dispute cannot be resolved through Buffer, Inc.’s internal processes, Buffer, Inc. has agreed to participate in the **DataRep DPF**

### Dispute Resolution Procedure

In the unlikely event that a dispute arises between you and Buffer regarding our handling of your User Personal Information, we will do our best to resolve it.

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Buffer commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF to VeraSafe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.
